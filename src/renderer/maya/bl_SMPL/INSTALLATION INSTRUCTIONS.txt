Dependencies:
------------
Numpy is required for running SMPL. Numpy is a python module that
can be installed following the instructions given here:
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html

or here:
http://blog.animateshmanimate.com/post/115538511578/python-numpy-and-maya-osx-and-windows

Please make sure you have numpy installed on your computer and accessible through Maya's python.
We are working towards removing this dependency. 



Installation Steps:
------------------
1)  Make sure no other copies of bl_SMPL will load with Maya

2)  Copy this 'bl_SMPL' folder into your Maya Plugins folder. eg:
    windows:     "<drive:>/Users/<user>/Documents/maya/scripts"
    OSX:        "/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/<version>/plugins"

3) Update the location of the SMPL files in line 46: 

	>>	SMPL_dir = expanduser('~/Documents/maya/plugins/')

4)  Inside Maya, go to Window >> Settings/Preferences >> Plug-in Manager
Locate the bl_SMPL.py script and check 'Loaded'
