Release Notes [SMPL_maya_plugin_v1.0.2  - Nov 9, 2015]
======================================================


Overview: 
---------
This release includes bug fixes in the plugin code and related data files. 
It also updates the plugin for more user-friendly control. 



Bug Fixes:
----------
- 	Shape and Pose blend shapes are both created as one blend shape node inside the FBX files. 
	These were two separate nodes in previous version, which is not compatible with some animation 
	software.
- 	The shape blend shapes for subjects of different body shapes now retain the values for the shape.
	The 10 shape blend shapes were reset to 0 in previous version of sample animation files (e.g. 
	'v1_f_lbs_10_207_0_mosh_cmu_0511.fbx', etc.). These should be 0 only for the basic model (i.e. 
	v1_f_lbs_10_207_0.fbx and v1_m_lbs_10_207_0.fbx). 
- 	Fixed error in 'Recompute Skeleton' function. The previous version of the plugin and data file 
	('joints_mat_v1.0.0.pkl') used female joint-regressor to create joint positions for both male 
	and female models. The plugin and data file have been updated to correctly recompute skeleton 
	for both male and female models.
-	Versioning for all files is now consistent with the plugin version. Version-numbers for files 
	associated with the Maya plugin will update with the plugin version.


New Features:
-------------
- 	Set Mesh to Bind-Pose: Plugin now provides a button to automatically set the model to a 
	T-pose (the bind-pose) position before recomputing the Skeleton.
- 	Human-readable joints: joints are now named according to the joint position in the body 
	instead of being named by numbers. 
- 	Shape and Pose blend shape names are now shortened to 'Shape###' and 'Pose###' for easier 
	control
-	Set Keyframes: Plugin now shows checkboxes next to 'Apply Pose Blendshapes' buttons. The user 
	can now choose to apply pose blendshapes with or without setting keyframes for the pose blendshapes.




Etymology:
----------
Model: 				male or female mesh object in the FBX file
Shape Blend Shapes: set of 10 blend shapes attached to each model that help change the body shape 
					of the model realistically.
Pose Blend Shapes:	set of 207 blend shapes attached to each model that deform with animation to
					fix lbs-skinning problems and to create more realistic mesh deformations at joints.
